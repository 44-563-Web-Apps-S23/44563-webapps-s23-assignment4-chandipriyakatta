<h4 class="POORMAN">POOR MAN.</h4><p class="speech"> You see, your honor, I've been poor all my life. I've never
    had much fun. I don't ask for a lot of money, but--I would like enough
    so that I could have some swell clothes, and--so that I could eat,
    drink, and be merry with the boys. You know, I just want to have a good
    time. Do you think you could fix it for me, Judge?</p>
    
 <h4 class="JUDGE">JUDGE.</h4><p class="directions"> [_Gazes at him sternly for a moment._]</p><p class="speech">So you just want to have a
    good time? Want me to take away your poverty? I suppose you have no
    moral weakness you want to change, no defects in your character that you
    want to better?</p>
