                so that I could have some swell clothes, and--so that I could eat,
                drink, and be merry with the boys. You know, I just want to have a good
                time. Do you think you could fix it for me, Judge?</p>

                good time? Want me to take away your poverty? I suppose you have no
                moral weakness you want to change, no defects in your character that you
                want to better?</p>
